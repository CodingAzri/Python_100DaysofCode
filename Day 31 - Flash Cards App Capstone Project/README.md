Designed a flash card app specifically for learning Malay.

Implemented the pandas module to read a CSV file. During gameplay, unknown words are saved in a new CSV for later testing.

Added functionality to remove known words from the pool whenever the âœ… button is pressed. This ensures that the app focuses on testing only on unknown words.
